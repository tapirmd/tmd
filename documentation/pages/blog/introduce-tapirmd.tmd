###### TapirMD: A Markup Language with Simple Syntax and Rich Semantics


As a tech article writer,





'''

// blog: Introduce TapirMD, a new powerful mark up doc formatting
//   * full featured. zig lib and wasm lib. Lib is fast.
//   * consistency (marks are at line start, 2+ chars for style marks, 3+ for atomo blocks, 1 for container blocks)
//   * try to use as few as possible non-content texts, to avoid reducing readability 
//   * base blocks, to avoid complexity of block hierarchy. New leaners might be some confused here.
//     But after understanding the rules, then ...
//   * custom. block, url
//   * prefer line-leading marks over line-ending marks
//   * line leading spaces have no semantic meaning. Identions and whitespace counts are bad pattern/characteristic.
//   * close style marks can be absent, style marks can be viewed a style toggle switches.
//   * header blocks can have multiple lines, any lower-lever headers are more eye-catching.
//   * link definitions can also, have multiple lines, 
//   * urls will not be automatically rendered as a link.
//   * char escaping ways
//   * line-end spacing
//   * steaming to code blocks


Thank you very much for your feedback. I truly appreciate it.

TapirMD is not a superset of Markdown or CommonMark. 
It simply inherits some of its DNA from Markdown. 
While Markdown is very simple, it is also highly underspecified and syntactic inconsistent. 
CommonMark improves on it slightly, but not fundamentally. 
Moreover, basic Markdown lacks many essential features that web content writers need.

Yes, none of these factors prevent it from being adopted widely. 
But for me, the limited feature set is the real blocker. 
I don’t want to rely on a patchwork of extensions and third-party tools.

TapirMD (where MD stands for `markup doc`) aims to address these shortcomings. 
It is a new language, deliberately not compatible with Markdown,
and never intended to fit within the Markdown ecosystem. 
Its official toolchain is designed to empower web content writers to create rich, 
feature-complete articles without relying on any third-party tools.

The spec is too long to serve as a landing page. 
Maybe a concise demo showcasing sample code on the leading page would be great. 
Thank you again for the constructive criticism.

TapirMD was primarily developed for my own needs as a technical writer, 
to produce content for my websites (see the .tmd soruce of my articles: 
https://tmd.tapirgames.com/use-cases.html). Markdown simply felt too limiting. 
I've been using TapirMD for over a year now and am quite satisfied with it. 
I'd be delighted if it proves helpful to other writers as well.
